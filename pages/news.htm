	<p class="news2">
		Still a lack of new hardware but I am getting increasing emails from 
		people asking for equipment.&nbsp; Once brave person is even building a 
		system board from scratch.&nbsp; Colour me impressed if it works.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		On the house front, a stalemate seems to have been reached.&nbsp; Buyers 
		not willing to drop prices further, sellers waiting for drops.&nbsp; 
		Looking at the financials, increasing repossessions Q3 should see the 
		drops resume.</p>
	<p class="news1">
		23-March-2009</p>
	<p class="news2">
		Not done a lot as the supply of new &amp; interesting hardware has just 
		about dried up.&nbsp; I suppose this was bound to happen eventually.&nbsp; 
		On the house front, price are crashing and I'm now interested again in 
		buying.&nbsp; At this rate it will be buy one get one free before too 
		long. </p>
	<p class="news1">
		04-May-2008</p>
	<p class="news2">
		Still too much work and not enough play.&nbsp; I should get a chance to 
		get some updates in as I'm not doing a silly amount of hours at work and 
		my house hunting has stopped.&nbsp; Amazing how fast things have turned 
		around, already back to Jan 2007 prices and going down fast. Very very 
		fast.</p>
	<p class="news1">
		08-Dec-2007</p>
	<p class="news2">
		Too much work, not enough life! Started putting up pages for the many 
		and varied disk systems for Nascom / Gemini.&nbsp; If anyone has 
		information on the rarer systems, hard drives etc, I would be grateful 
		to get copies and scans.</p>
	<p class="news2">
		So, looks like the great housing crash is on.&nbsp; Reminds me of the 
		late 80's, early 90's once again.&nbsp; Drop of 1.1% last month, so 
		that's a £2750 drop on a £250,000 house which equates to an average 
		earning of around £4000 before tax per month.&nbsp; So, hands up, how 
		many people can afford an annual pay cut of £48,000?		 
		</p>
	<p class="news1">
		22-Oct-2007</p>
	<p class="news2">
		I've finally been able to get hold of a Nascom 1 PSU.&nbsp; Images added 
		but still no paper work. Anyone got a scan of the manual?&nbsp;		 
		</p>
	<p class="news2">
		In other news, the house hunt has been postponed.&nbsp; Since prices are 
		now on the slide I'm going to wait to see what happens unless someone 
		has a good offer.&nbsp; Any BTL (Buy to Loose) feeling the pinch and want a quick way 
		out?</p>
	<p class="news1">
		2-Sep-2007</p>
	<p class="news2">
		I'm back! I've been far too busy completing a project at work and trying 
		to buy a house (For more information on a tail of woe, see the new pages).  
		Started to add high quality scans being donated by Ole Kiilerich from Denmark. Cheers!

	<p class="news2">
		General tidy up on missing images, plus a few new ones in the Gemini 
		section</p>
	<p class="news1">
		23-Apr-2007</p>
	<p class="news2">
		Added information on MAP-80 Systems products.&nbsp; I only have a 
		limited amount of information so anything in this area would be 
		gratefully received.</p>

	<p class="news2">
		Progress is slow due to pressure of work.&nbsp; I have now made a start 
		in the Nascom section.&nbsp; I would also like to give thanks to Freek 
		Oust who has been emailing me with a number of very high quality 
		document scans for the web site.</p>

		Uploading changes as I get them done.</p>
	<p class="news1">
		12-Nov-2006
	</p>
	<p class="news2">
		All Change! Over the last year it has been increasingly difficult to 
		source new and interesting 80-BUS related items.
		However, I have recently acquired two large batches of interesting stuff.  Due to the changes needed to 
		accommodate these new items, 
		I've taken the opportunity to revamp the site.  The full update will take a few weeks so please be patient.
