<p class="news1">House - An Update for August</p>
<p class="news2">Prices age going up scream the headlines.&nbsp; Except they are 
not when you actually read the figures.&nbsp; More vested interest brainwashing 
for the sheeple.&nbsp; Make up you own mind after reading this:</p>
<p class="news2">
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/julian-knight-so-house-prices-are-up-well-not-in-the-real-world-1766020.html">
The Independent</a></p>
<p class="news2">
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/5957481/House-prices-are-still-falling.html">
The Telegraph</a></p>
<p class="news2">I love the smell of <em>recession in the morning</em>, smells 
like... victory [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now">sic</a>]</p>
<p class="news1">House - An Update...two years later...</p>
<p class="news2">Wow, was I lucky in not getting into the market.&nbsp; Now 
prices are going down faster than a lemming which has just found a cliff.&nbsp; 
I would just like to say a big thank you to everyone who turned down my offers, 
with special thanks going to the two vendors listed below. Thank-you, thank-you, 
thank-you!</p>
<p class="news2">Don't get me wrong, I'm still interested in buying, but now it 
is a buyers market so the rules are a bit different.</p>
<p class="news2">So, if you want a quick sale this is what I'm looking for:</p>
<p class="news2">Type: Semi detached / end of terrace house.</p>
<p class="news2">Bedrooms: Minimum 3</p>
<p class="news2">Parking: Driveway and garage on the property. Not interested in a 
garage in a block or communal parking</p>
<p class="news2">Location: Bracknell, Twyford, Newbury or similar area</p>
<p class="news2">Price: Maximum of &pound;200,000</p>
<p class="news1">......</p>
<p class="news1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="news1">House [ Andy, have you not got anything better to do :) ]</p>
<p class="news2">As some of you may be aware, I've been trying to buy a house 
since April '07 this year.&nbsp; Still no progress despite finding two properties 
and making sensible offers.&nbsp; So what has happened?</p>
<p class="news1">Prices Now Sliding - Official</p>
<p class="news2">With the HBOS et al all showing price drops we are now back to 
early 2007 prices and still heading downwards at a great rate.&nbsp; If this 
crash goes like the others it will bottom out in around 18 months time (Q3 
2009).&nbsp; Great news for me, &pound;10k's off what I will pay, cash buyer, no 
chain.&nbsp; Might see you in 2009 if you are selling!</p>
<p class="news2">I would just like to say a big thank you to Gordon Brown (Crash 
Gordon ?!?) for finally buggering it all up.&nbsp; Sort of compensates for the 
massive extra taxes I've been paying.&nbsp; What an idiot.</p>
<p class="news2">I know a lot of you will be saying 'my house won't drop', 'its 
different this time' etc etc...Well I suggest you look for yourself.&nbsp; 
Seeing is believing after all.&nbsp; Check out this plug-in for Firefox,
<a href="http://www.property-tools.co.uk/">Property Bee</a>.&nbsp; It allows you 
track changes on the <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/">rightmove</a> web 
site.&nbsp; Give it a week or two then see what has happened.&nbsp; Where I'm 
looking, Bracknell has already had drops of between 10% and 20% since the new 
year.&nbsp; Excellent!</p>
<p class="news1">Not So Breaking News - House Prices Still Sliding</p>
<p class="news2">Another 1.1% in November.&nbsp; So, including inflation, that 
is around a drop of around 15% per year.&nbsp; On a &pound;250,000 property (Quite 
cheap for the South of England) then that equates to an earning net amount of 
around &pound;40,000. (In the order of &pound;55,000 earnings using present tax, national 
insurance etc). Ouch.</p>
<p class="news2">So, like so many others I'm now out of the house buying market. 
Why purchase a depreciating asset?</p>
<p class="news1">Breaking News - House Prices Sliding</p>
<p class="news2">Well, what do you know.&nbsp; Prices are going into reverse at 
last.&nbsp; All of a sudden I'm a rare commodity, a buyer with no chain and 
cash.&nbsp; Trouble is, like most buyers in my situation, I ain't buying without 
a nice fat discount now.&nbsp; A small economics lesson to vendors, your house 
is not worth what you ask, its worth what someone will pay and in most places 
this is between 10% and 20% below what you think, and definitely below what your 
estate agent said!</p>
<p class="news2">For amusing reading see
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/">this</a> site.</p>
<p class="news2">I would just like to send a personal thanks to Northern Rock 
for setting the house price crash ball rolling. Ta :)</p>
<p class="news1">Vendors - A Short History</p>
<p class="news2"><u>Vendor 1</u> - Made offer then the vendor vanishes.&nbsp; No 
contact. Zilch. Nothing. Sod all. Three months on, still won't talk to the 
estate agent.&nbsp; Hello!, why put a house up for sale, get people to view it 
then act like&nbsp; a trappist?- duh!</p>
<p class="news2">Ok. Vendor has decided to become a hermit. Lets just accept 
that and move on....</p>
<p class="news2"><u>Vendor 2</u> - Usual story, find house, make offer, get into 
negotiations.&nbsp; Eventually get to an agreeable price so make formal final 
offer.&nbsp; Vendor suddenly takes an offer to rent the house out for a year. 
WTF? Why go through all the hassle of selling a place if you want to rent it 
out? Ok, where do I send my bill for time &amp; expenses?</p>
<p class="news2"><i>Note: As things have turned out, if he had sold the house to 
me he would not have suffered the recent price&nbsp; drop.&nbsp; All in all, he 
is losing a lot of money now on the property, far more than any rent will make 
up.&nbsp; Nice to see greed gets its own rewards sometimes :)</i></p>
<p class="news1">Estate Agents - Why Won't You Listen?</p>
<p class="news2">A brief list of things I've found looking at houses after 
estate agents have assured me they are 'just what I'm looking for'....With 
apologies to the one very notable and honest exception I've dealt with....</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">When I say 'Semi / End Terrace', I don't mean a mid terrace. 
Really. I don't.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">When I say 'Off Road Parking', I don't mean communal parking 
half&nbsp; a days walk away</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">When I say 'Off Road Parking', I don't mean a garden covered in 
gravel that is so small you would have problems getting a Smart Car onto it</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">When I say 'Off Road Parking', I don't mean a garden covered in 
concrete where you have not even bothered to get a drop kerb sorted out</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">When I say 'Garage', I don't mean something so small you can't 
get a Ford Anglia into. If you can't get a car in and open the doors, it is not 
a garage, it is a shed with a nice door</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">When I say&nbsp; 'Power in Garage', I don't mean a garage in a vandalised block that has no hope of ever getting services laid 
on</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">No, despite the price, I don't really want to live in a 
	house situated somewhere that looks like down town Baghdad</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">No, it may be nice but I do really think the national grid 
transmission lines directly above the roof may cause some reselling issues</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">No, putting mock Tudor beams in all rooms does not add 10K to 
the price compared with every other house in the area</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="news2">If I can stretch my arms out and touch both walls in a room, 
then it is not <i>Deceptively Spacious</i>, it is small. Very very small.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="news1">Sell Me A House...Please ?!? </p>
<p class="news2">Anyone got a house for sale?&nbsp; If so and you meet these 
criterion, please drop me an email. Let's save on those estate agent fees! What 
I'm looking for is not very complicated:</p>
<p class="news2">Location: Windsor, Maidenhead, Bracknell, Ascot, Twyford, 
Binfield, Wokingham, Newbury and all bits in between. </p>
<p class="news2">Type: House, end of terrace or semi</p>
<p class="news2">Bedrooms: Minimum 2</p>
<p class="news2">Parking: Driveway or attached garage. Must be off road. Not interested in a 
garage in a block or communal parking</p>
<p class="news2">Price: Depends on location etc but in the range &pound;200,000 to 
&pound;250,000</p>
<p class="news2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="news2">I'm not in a chain so can complete very quickly.&nbsp; Anyone 
got anything? Drop me an email and save on estate agent fees at :</p>
